                    <p>My name is DeLson.  Some know me as the Supreme OverLord of the Ls.  Here, I am your sitting @<u>Vice President</u>.  
                        I have been so for nearly a year now. Typing that out now, I honestly can't believe it has been that long.  
                        It's been quite a year, boys.  And if we're being honest, I've probably been online more than anybody else 
                        for that year lol.  We've done a heck of a lot this year: from some truly epic and beautifully chaotic game 
                        nights to the everyday memes in #<b>chill-memes</b> (sometimes not so chill tho).  I would be honored to  continue 
                        to be your @<u>Vice President</u> if you'll have me.  I think this server is destined for some pretty great stuff, 
                        and I think I am pretty well qualified to help lead it into said epicness.  I am also probably one of, if not 
                        the most experienced person on this server when it comes to Discord server setup, moderation, and use.</p>

                    <p>I am gonna keep on going here.  I should probably just have ended it earlier, but that isn't really my style.  
                        So, in true DeLson fashion, I will keep going with this rant for no reason and remain completely self-aware the 
                        whole time.  Lorem ipsum...jk lol. Golly, that would be annoying.  Anyway, here is a link that you should send 
                        to anyone that tells you not to vote for me: <a href="../no.html" target="_blank">https://delson.fun/no</a>.  
                        If you want, you could send them this one as well: <a href="../videos/NotAVirus.mp4" target="_blank">https://delson.fun/videos/NotAVirus.mp4</a>. 
                        Anyway maybe that'll be all...jk imagine if I ended there.</p>
